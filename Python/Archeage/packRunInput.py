#-------------TO DO--------------
# 1. Rewrite the output file to where the K: line has the duration held on it as well [X]
# 2. Rewrite the output file to also contain the time between button presses - e.g. K:a 2.56 2.43 [X]
# 3. Make sure the packRunOutput file is made with multi threading for each button press, perhaps set a max num of threads,
#    so that each button isnt waiting on the sleep function of other buttons []

#-------------BUGS---------------
# 1. <RESOLVED> [DOUBLE REGISTER OF KEY] For example, holding 'w' and then holding 'd', followed by releasing 'w' will make 'd' register as being pressed again,
#  instead of merely maintaining the hold - leads to issue where 'd' is clicked again, causing a stutter in movement,
#  also causing the log to state 'K: d intervalTime1 durationTime1' and directly after, 'K: d intervalTime2 durationTime1' so that 
#  the duration time of it being held is the same, but the interval time between button presses is different
#
# 2. <RESOLVED> [Key Error When Deleting Times] - For example, hold 'w', click and release 'd', then click and release 'd' - do so in 
#  quick succession, and you get a key error. - this is due to previous bug fix for issue 1 --> setting heldDownKey = ""
#  caused a double click of a button to register it as a continuous hold, as the heldDownKey button was still equal to the same key
#  and so did not view it as a new button click, but as a hold. 
#
# 3. <WIP> [Special Keys do not work] need to troubleshoot allowing special keys such as Alt and Shift to work in this method
