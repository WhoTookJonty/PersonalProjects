Algorithm Explanation:
    Pick a pivot point, arbitrarily, but the median of the elements is preferred. Usually the end number is chosen. 
    Create a left pointer (first element), and a righter pointer (last element-1: if the last element was chosen 
    for pivot). These form the partition. Compare the left and right pointers. If the left is greater than pivot,
    and the right is less than the pivot, swap the elements. Keep incrementing the left pointer and decremeneting
    the right pointer until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer (in index). Once achieved,
